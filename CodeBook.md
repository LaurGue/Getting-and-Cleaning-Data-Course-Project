Variables :
 
urlFile <- Link tro the ZIP File
dateDownloaded <- Save the download date

df_xTrain <- DataFrame for storage Training Set
df_yTrain <- DataFrame for storage Training Label
df_subjectTrain <- DataFrame for storage Subject Training
df_xTest <- DataFrame for storage Test Set
df_yTest <- DataFrame for storage Test Label
df_subjectTest <- DataFrame for storage Subject Test
df_featureLabel <- DataFrame for storage Feature Label
df_activityLabel <- DataFrame for storage activity Label
df_xData <- DataFrame with all/merge (Train + Test) Set
df_yData <- DataFrame with all/merge (Train + Test) Label
df_subjectData <- DataFrame with all/merge (Train + Test) Subject
df_yDataF <- dataFrame factor of Activity names
dataSet <- dataframe with the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
index <- vector for extract the mean / Standard deviation / subject / Activity
secondDataSet <- second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Explanation :

Create a directory (if not already exist)
save the ZIP File
extract File
Create dataFrame with the diffÃ©rents file from the Extract ZIP
Merge the differents dataFrame for make one dataframe
rename col
create a new file tidydata.txt

Select the col for create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
create a new file tidydataAV.txt
